# photo_collection
A university project that implements the idea of a photo collection. Available administrator and user rights, search, sort and 3 linked tables.

In this project I use SQL to work with the databases and I use PHP to create the logic. Also I use a little CSS for styling.
The idea of the project is based on creating a service through which you can easily create, edit and delete your photo collection.

![first look](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113947950/205944585-11147ae6-4352-47bd-a09b-9432592a736d.PNG)

As a standard user, you can browse existing photos in the database. Also you can use the search engine to find your desired image.

Included in the functionality of the website sorting by name, category and photo.

![sort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113947950/205947118-7b1bb0c6-d8ea-4c22-9ade-e80023400cf9.PNG)

You can login as an administrator. To do this you need to enter your username and password 

![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113947950/205947914-6cae08ac-abf6-4b2d-bfa7-cd7f6f156875.PNG)

As an administrator, now you have access to the new functionality. For example, you can add a new photo or delete existing ones.

If you want to add a new photo you need to insert a link to it, create a name for it and select a category.

![info about new phot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113947950/205949768-998e6071-3a21-4bf3-80ae-15c600eadd96.PNG)

If all the fields are correct, your photo will be added successfully.

And we will be able to see this photo in the general photo collection

If the data were specified incorrectly or not specified in principle. Of course the web page will notify you of the error.

If you want to delete a photo, the website will ask you to specify your action.

![delete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113947950/205951613-c5fb2035-8bbd-46fb-b636-c5b407e36226.PNG)

This is the first version of the project. In which the main intended functionality is implemented. Thank you for your attention.
